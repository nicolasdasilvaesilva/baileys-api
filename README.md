This project provides an API interface for interacting with WhatsApp using the [Baileys library](https://github.com/WhiskeySockets/Baileys).

> [!NOTE]
> 🇧🇷 Esse README também está disponível em português: [README-pt.md](README-pt.md)

## Stack

- **Runtime**: [Bun](https://bun.sh/)
- **HTTP Framework**: [Elysia.js](https://elysiajs.com/)
- **Database**: [Redis](https://redis.io/) (for session storage and API key management)
- **WhatsApp Integration**: [@whiskeysockets/baileys](https://github.com/WhiskeySockets/Baileys)

> [!NOTE]
> This project is not meant to be a full-fledged WhatsApp server. It is a wrapper around the Baileys library, providing an HTTP interface for easier integration with other applications.
>
> Thus, we do not store WhatsApp messages or any other data (aside from credentials for auto-reconnecting).
>
> If you need a chat application with a database, consider using our fork of [Chatwoot](https://github.com/indica-facil/chatwoot/), which integrates with this API.

## Functionality

The API exposes the following endpoints. Keep in mind this project is in early development, and many features are still being implemented.

> [!NOTE]
> See also our [Swagger documentation](https://indica-facil.github.io/baileys-api/) for a more detailed overview of the API.

### Status

- `GET /status`: Checks if the server is running. Returns "OK" if the server is healthy.
- `GET /status/auth`: Checks if the provided API key is valid. Returns "OK" if authenticated.

### Connections

- `POST /connections/:phoneNumber`: Initiates a new WhatsApp connection for the given phone number.
- `PATCH /connections/:phoneNumber/presence`: Updates the presence status for a connection.
- `POST /connections/:phoneNumber/send-message`: Sends a message through an active connection.
- `POST /connections/:phoneNumber/read-messages`: Marks messages as read.
- `DELETE /connections/:phoneNumber`: Logs out and disconnects a WhatsApp connection.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `phoneNumber` parameter in the URL should be in the format `+<country_code><phone_number>`, e.g. `+551234567890`.

### Admin

- `POST /admin/connections/logout-all`: Logs out all active WhatsApp connections. (Requires admin role API key)

## Deployment

This project includes a [`docker-compose.coolify.yml`](./docker-compose.coolify.yml) file ready for deployment on [Coolify](https://coolify.io/).

### Coolify Deployment

The provided Docker Compose file is configured to work within a Coolify environment that has an existing Redis instance on the same network. The API will connect to this Redis instance using the `REDIS_URL` and `REDIS_PASSWORD` environment variables that you should provide in the environment variables section of the Coolify dashboard.

The compose file also automates the creation of a default API key. This key is generated using `SERVICE_PASSWORD_64_DEFAULTAPIKEY` (an auto-generated Coolify service password) and can be retrieved from the service's environment variables in the Coolify dashboard.

### Other Docker Environments

The `docker-compose.coolify.yml` can be adapted for other Docker environments. You may need to:

1.  **Provide a Redis Instance**:
    - If you have an existing Redis instance, update the `REDIS_URL` and `REDIS_PASSWORD` environment variables in the `docker-compose.yml` file to point to your Redis service.
    - Alternatively, you can add a new Redis service definition to the `docker-compose.yml` file.
2.  **API Key Management**:
    - In production/non-development environments, authentication is required. The `manage-api-keys.ts` script is used to create and manage API keys.
    - The provided `docker-compose.coolify.yml` automatically creates a user API key using the command: `bun manage-api-keys create user ${SERVICE_PASSWORD_64_DEFAULTAPIKEY}`. You can adapt this or run the script manually within the container or a separate environment to generate your API keys.
    - To create an API key manually:
      ```bash
      bun scripts/manage-api-keys.ts create <role> [key]
      ```
      (e.g., `bun scripts/manage-api-keys.ts create user mysecretapikey`)
    - Store these keys securely and provide them in the `x-api-key` header for authenticated requests.
    - In development (`NODE_ENV=development`), authentication is bypassed.

### Scaling Horizontally (Multiple Instances)

Running more than one instance against the same Redis is supported through a proxy + workers topology. Each WhatsApp identity is owned via a Redis **lease** (renewed periodically, self-fencing on loss), so two instances never fight over the same phone number with `conflict/replaced` loops.

Roles, selected via the `ROLE` env var:

- `standalone` (default) — single instance serving HTTP directly, exactly like before. It also participates in the lease protocol, which gives rolling deploys a graceful handoff for free: on SIGTERM the old container closes its sockets and releases its leases before the new one claims them — no churn window.
- `worker` — holds the WhatsApp sockets, never exposed to clients. Claims unleased phones up to its fair share of the cluster, renews leases, sheds load gradually when over-share (rebalance), and hands everything off on SIGTERM.
- `proxy` — the single client-facing entry point. Stateless: resolves which worker owns each phone via Redis and forwards requests (including `GET /media/:messageId`, routed to the instance holding the file). Point your client (e.g. chatwoot's `BAILEYS_PROVIDER_DEFAULT_URL`) at the proxy.

See [`docker-compose.cluster.yml`](./docker-compose.cluster.yml) for a complete example (1 proxy + 2 workers + Redis with AOF).

Behavior under the common scenarios:

- **A worker crashes** — its leases expire within `CLUSTER_LEASE_TTL_MS` (default 30s); survivors claim the orphaned phones with limited reconnect concurrency and jitter, so a 50-connection failover proceeds in waves instead of a storm.
- **A new worker joins** — it steals nothing at boot (everything is leased). Overloaded workers detect they are above the cluster fair share and migrate one connection at a time (rate-limited, with a directed handoff so the migration lands on the underloaded worker and never ping-pongs). Victims are chosen idle-first: connections with no message traffic within `CLUSTER_REBALANCE_IDLE_THRESHOLD_MS` (default 5 min) and no in-flight webhooks migrate invisibly; if everything is mid-conversation the migration is deferred to the next interval, unless the imbalance exceeds 2x the fair share, in which case the least active connection moves anyway. A 100-connection 1→2 migration equalizes gradually (~8 minutes at default intervals), each phone seeing a single brief reconnect.
- **Rolling deploy** — bring the new container up before stopping the old one; the new worker waits (leases arbitrate), and the old worker's SIGTERM handoff transfers connections in seconds with zero `conflict/replaced` events. Make sure the orchestrator's stop grace period exceeds `CLUSTER_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT_MS`.
- **Redis goes down** — workers keep their sockets (messages keep flowing) and pause claims; on recovery each worker re-asserts the leases it already holds, with no reconnects.

Operational requirements:

- Redis must persist with **AOF** (`appendonly yes`): the Signal auth state lives there, and restoring a stale snapshot regresses the crypto ratchet, forcing re-pairing.
- Workers must be reachable from the proxy on the shared network (`WORKER_BASE_URL`, defaults to the container hostname).
- Pending-QR pairings are tied to the instance showing the QR code; they are excluded from failover/rebalance and restart via a new `POST /connections` if that instance dies.
- One caveat on the **first** deploy of a lease-aware version over a non-lease version: the old container does not participate in the protocol, so that one rollout still shows the legacy reconnect churn. Subsequent deploys are clean.

#### Workers across multiple hosts

[`docker-compose.cluster.yml`](./docker-compose.cluster.yml) runs every service on one host, where the proxy reaches each worker by its Docker-network hostname (the default `WORKER_BASE_URL=http://<hostname>:<port>`). To spread workers across separate hosts (or VMs/regions), three things must hold:

- **Every worker advertises a reachable address.** Set `WORKER_BASE_URL` explicitly on each worker to an address the proxy can reach from its host, e.g. `WORKER_BASE_URL=http://10.0.0.21:3025` (private IP or internal DNS name). The default container-hostname value only resolves inside a shared Docker network and will not work across hosts.
- **All hosts share one Redis.** Workers and the proxy coordinate exclusively through Redis (leases, registry, route invalidation), so every node points `REDIS_URL` at the same instance. Keep it close to the workers — the Signal auth state reads/writes sit on the hot path.
- **The network between nodes is private.** Inter-node traffic carries Signal auth state and proxied message payloads. Run it over a private network, VPN (e.g. WireGuard/Tailscale), or cloud VPC, and expose **only the proxy** to clients. Worker HTTP ports and Redis must never be publicly reachable — set `REDIS_PASSWORD` and firewall those ports to the cluster's own hosts.

Example: a proxy on host A (`WORKER_BASE_URL` unused), workers on hosts B and C each with `ROLE=worker`, a distinct `INSTANCE_ID`, `WORKER_BASE_URL` set to their private IP, and all three sharing `REDIS_URL`/`REDIS_PASSWORD`. The proxy resolves ownership from Redis and forwards to whichever worker holds the phone, regardless of host.

4.  **(Optional) Create API Keys for Development (if not bypassing auth)**:
    If you wish to test authentication in development, you can create API keys:

    ```bash
    bun scripts/manage-api-keys.ts create user yourdesiredapikey
    ```

    Remember to set `NODE_ENV` to something other than `development` in your `.env` if you want to enforce API key usage locally.

5.  **Start the development server**:

    ```bash
    bun dev
    ```

    The server will watch for file changes and automatically restart.

6.  **API Documentation**:
    Open [http://localhost:3025/swagger](http://localhost:3025/swagger) in your browser to view the Swagger API documentation and test the endpoints.
